Several such domains are among the top five queried hosts (async.empirehost.me, api.insight.synology.com, routing.bgp.technology, 127.0.0.1.stackoverflow.tech). This persistence and volume point to either continuous tracking/ad activity or misconfigured/compromised devices on the LAN and requires immediate action.\n\nWhy block (immediate):\n- async.empirehost.me: Repeatedly high-volume, .me TLD and generic 'async' naming; historically flagged and matches suspicious/ad/tracker patterns.\n- 127.0.0.1.stackoverflow.tech: Embeds an IP in a subdomain and uses an anomalous pattern/TLD; previously flagged as malicious/misconfigured.\n- tracker.* entries (tracker.moeking.me, tracker.torrent.eu.org, ipv4.tracker.harry.lu, tracker.birkenwald.de, tracker.opentrackr.org, tracker.cyberia.is, tracker.tiny-vps.com): Explicit 'tracker' prefix\u2014match the block rule for tracking endpoints.\n- telemetry.qdrant.io and the two AWS telemetry entries (telemetry.cell-0... and cell-0...telemetry...): Contain telemetry.*/insight-like patterns. Per telemetry guidance, these are nonessential for most consumer functionality and are flagged for blocking to protect privacy and reduce data exfiltration risk.\n\nWhy watch (map and verify before blocking):\n- api.insight.synology.com: Very high query count and contains 'insight' (telemetry). Likely a Synology NAS on the LAN. Because blocking may impact NAS features, map which device initiates the queries and confirm if the owner wants telemetry disabled before blocking; if the origin is unexpected or multiplies across devices, escalate immediately.\n- routing.bgp.technology: High-frequency, unusual name/TLD.

The dataset shows multiple explicit trackers/telemetry and several suspicious-pattern domains among the top queries, but also legitimate system/CDN activity. Immediate blocking of explicit trackers/telemetry is recommended while continuing to monitor high-volume ambiguous hosts to avoid breaking needed functionality.\n\nDomains blocked (reasons):\n- async.empirehost.me: .me TLD + generic 'async' subdomain and high query volume; matches suspicious TLD/pattern guidance and prior runs flagged it \u2014 block as likely ad/tracker.\n- 127.0.0.1.stackoverflow.tech: anomalous subdomain that embeds an IP and uses an unusual .tech pattern; previously flagged as suspicious/misconfigured \u2014 block.\n- telemetry.qdrant.io: explicit telemetry.* pattern \u2014 per rules telemetry endpoints are nonessential for most home functionality and should be blocked for privacy.\n- otel.gitkraken.com: 'otel' (OpenTelemetry) endpoint used for telemetry/metrics \u2014 treat like telemetry and block.\n- tracker.torrent.eu.org, tracker.opentrackr.org, tracker.moeking.me, tracker.birkenwald.de, tracker.cyberia.is: explicit 'tracker' hosts listed in suspicious_domains \u2014 match the block pattern for trackers and should be blocked.\n\nDomains watched (reasons / next steps):\n- api.insight.synology.com (top domain, 172 queries): Contains 'insight' (telemetry) and is likely a Synology NAS on the LAN. Because blocking could break NAS features, do NOT block immediately; instead map queries to the NAS device and ask the owner whether telemetry may be disabled. If origin is unexpected or queries spike across devices, escalate.\n- routing.bgp.technology (86 queries): Unusual name/TLD with significant volume. Could be legitimate monitoring/routing tooling or a misbehaving/malicious process. Map to originating client/process; if origin is unknown or unexpected, investigate and consider isolation.\n- onedscolprdwus15.westus.cloudapp.azure.com: Azure-hosted OneDrive/Office-like naming. Watch and map before blocking to avoid breaking user services.\n- checkip.synology.com: Synology-related; watch in conjunction with api.insight.synology.com to determine device behavior and whether user wants these services.\n- scrobbles.plex.tv: Plex scrobbling is a user-facing feature (telemetry-like but functional for some users). Watch and verify whether the user expects this behavior before blocking.\n- shed.dual-low.part-0017.t-0009.t-msedge.net: Appears to be Microsoft CDN/edge host (msedge/net); unusual long subdomain \u2014 map to client/process. Avoid immediate block if it maps to legitimate app updates/CDN traffic.\n\nDomains allowed (reasons):\n- dns.msftncsi.com: Microsoft network connectivity check \u2014 NEVER BLOCK per rules.\n- ipcdn.apple.com: Apple CDN \u2014 NEVER BLOCK *.apple.com or Apple CDN hosts to avoid breaking OS/app functionality.\n- clients4.google.com and google.com: Core Google endpoints; unless telemetry-specific subdomains appear, treat normal Google usage as allowed. If clients4.google.com shows telemetry subdomains later, reevaluate.\n- marketplace.visualstudio.com: Microsoft marketplace/service host; treat as allowed unless telemetry subdomains (analytics/telemetry) are identified.\n\nOperational recommendations:\n1) Apply immediate DNS blocks for the explicit tracker and telemetry domains listed above to reduce tracking and data leakage.\n2) For watched hosts (especially api.insight.synology.com and routing.bgp.technology), map queries to DHCP client MACs, hostnames, and timestamps to identify the source device and process. Confirm with device owners before blocking Synology/OneDrive-like endpoints.\n3) If any watched domain originates from unexpected devices or multiple clients, escalate to deeper device inspection (running processes, recent installs, outbound IPs) and consider temporary network isolation.\n4) Continue to NEVER BLOCK the listed core infrastructure patterns (Microsoft network check, Apple domains, Google infra patterns, Cloudflare/Akamai/AWS CDNs). However, apply the telemetry/analytics/track blocking rules to subdomains from any provider when they match telemetry/track patterns.\n5) Monitor for fallback or new tracker endpoints after blocking \u2014 attackers/trackers sometimes rotate domains. Update blocklist as new telemetry/track patterns appear.\n\nThis WATCH posture balances privacy (block evident trackers/telemetry) with operational continuity (avoid breaking NAS/OneDrive/Apple functionality) while requiring mapping of ambiguous high-volume domains to originating clients before more aggressive action.", "ts": "2026-01-09T10:38:20.684774", "summary": {"total_queries": 1320, "new_domains_count": 10, "top_domain": ["api.insight.synology.com", 172]}}
